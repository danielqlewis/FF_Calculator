Finite Field Calculator (Work in Progress)
A Python-based calculator for performing arithmetic in finite fields. Currently implementing the backend functionality, with plans for a GUI interface.
Current Features

ModularPolynomial class supporting:

Addition and subtraction
Multiplication
Division with remainder
Polynomial evaluation
All operations performed with coefficients in Z/pZ (integers modulo a prime p)



In Development

Finding irreducible polynomials
Finite field arithmetic functionality
GUI interface using Tkinter

Purpose
This project is being developed as both a practical tool for finite field computations and as a demonstration of:

Object-oriented programming in Python
Mathematical algorithm implementation
Testing and documentation practices

Current Limitations

Modulus must be prime
Optimized for polynomials of degree ≤ 12
Modulus size limited to ≤ 101
